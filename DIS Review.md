**Fitts’ Law **Shannon’s Formulation:   $T_{pos=}a+blog_2(\frac{D}{W}+1)$

User Errors are design Errors

**Gestalt Laws**: Good Shape; Proximity; Closure; Similarity; Continuity; Experience; Common Fate 

**Affordance** refers to the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used 

**False Affordance** suggest actions that are not actually possible or the right ones 

**Signifiers**: The signaling component of an affordance. More important than affordances

**Mappings**: Relationship between the controls, the actions, and intended results. 

Good mappings are natural: Spatial Analogies; Perceptual Analogies; Biological Analogies

**Spatial Analogies**: Arrange controls in the same way that their real-world counterparts are arranged (Room lamps; Driving wheel; Car stereo audio fader)

**Perceptual Analogies:** The UI element (input control or output display) is an imitation of the device itself (Car seat controls, Scrolling&Panning)

**Biological/Cultural Analogies**: Natural for all additive dimensions (amount, heat, volume, brightness, weight); But not for substitutive dimensions (e.g. color, pitch, taste, location); Order from top to bottom

**Some Design Principles**: Discoverability (state and actions easy to determine); Good conceptual model (Operations and results are presented consistently; User gets a coherent image of the system); Good mappings (between actions and results; Controls and their effects; System state and its visualization); Good feedback (About results, complete and continuous)

**Constraints**: Avoid usage errors; Minimize the information to be remembered

Types: physical; semantic; logical; cultural

**Physical Constraints**: Rely upon the physical properties (shape, size) to constrain possible actions (key constraints; car key)

**Semantic Constraints**: Rely upon our knowledge of the current situation and of the world to constrain actions 

**Logical Constraints:** Rely upon logical conclusions to constrain possible actions (completeness, sequence; natural mappings often employ logical constraints, eg. left switch=left lamp)

**Cultural Constraints:** Rely upon generally accepted cultural standards to constrain possible actions (Labels are to be read; Red=Stop)

**Forcing Functions:** Can help to avoid errors; extreme physical constraints (seat belts)

Types: Lock-out (prevents an action, e.g. stairways to basements); Lock-in (prevents prematurely stopping an action, e.g. soft power-off switch to avoid data loss); Interlock (enforce correct sequence, e.g. microwave turning off when opened, shelves in restroom)

**Execution**: Goal (form the goal); Plan (the action); Specify (an action sequence); Perform (the action sequence)

**Evaluation:** Perceive (the state of the world); Interpret (the perception); Compare (the outcome to the goal)

**Gulf of Execution:** with signifiers, constraints, mappings, and conceptual models

**Gulf of Evaluation:** with feedback and conceptual models

What do I want to accomplish? —Goal	What are the alternative action sequences? —Plan

What action can I do? —Specify		How do I do it? —Perform

What happened? —Perceive			What does it mean? —Interpret 	

Is this ok? Have I accomplished my goal? —Compare 

Levels of Processing: Visceral Level; Behavioral Level; Reflective Level 

**Visceral Level:** Totally subconscious; reflex action, impulse, e.g. feeling warmth and happiness, not exactly “emotion”, more like hard-coded responses

**Behavioral Level:** “Classic Usability”; “Learned Responses”, triggered by situations matching a pattern; mostly subconscious, fast, lower level of emotions e.g. sports, walking; Associated with an expectation, e.g. Hope or fear (feedback); Relief or despair (conceptual model)

**Reflective Level:** Conscious thinking on events that have occurred; slow, deep thinking; highest level of emotions; retained in memory 

Types of Knowledge: **Declarative Knowledge** (“what?”)(Facts; Rules; Easy to write down and teach); **Procedural Knowledge** (“how”)(How to play an instrument? Hard to write down, subconscious; Hard to teach, bet by demo/training) Design can easily convey declarative knowledge

Knowledge in the World: Nothing to remember; but only there while you see it; especially difficult with things that are not very import to you. Solutions: Reminders

Decision Structures: **Shallow** (No planning required, e.g., ice cream menu); **Narrow** (No deep thinking required, e.g, cook book instructions, start car); Wide and deep structures (games like chess)

**Feedback**: Feedback communicates to the user the current system state, success or failure of action and results of actions (Good feedback: immediate, informative and clear, the right amount, prioritized)

Feedforward is to execution as feedback is to evaluation 

**Feedforward** (information that helps you know what you can do; uses signifiers, constraints, and mappings, e.g., feeling keys before typing eyes-free)

Perform root cause analysis: Analyze why error occurred; Human error is just the end of a casual chain

**Mistakes**: Result of conscious decision/thinking; often major events; Hard to detect; Wrong goal, wrong plan, leaping to wring conclusions, false causalities

Classes: **Memory-lapse** (memory fails during goal-setting, planning or evaluation); **Knowledge-based** (wrong evaluation of the situation because of incomplete knowledge, e.g report the weight of an item in pounds instead of kilograms); **Rule-based** (correct evaluation of situation but wrong course of action)

**Slips**: Goal formed but execution messed up; usually easy to discover; often caused by lack of attention, busy, tired, bored

Classes of Slips: **Action-based** (the wrong action is performed); **Memory-lapse** (memory fails, and the intended action is not done or its results not evaluated, e.g., forget to lock the door)

**Action-based slips:** **Capture slips**(two action sequence with similar initial but different later sequence, e.g., driving to work on a Sunday); **Description-Similarity Slip** (Intention not described in enough detail, fitting 2 different action sequences, e.g., throwing shits into toilet instead of laundry basket); **Mode errors **(Triggering the wrong action because the device is in a different mode than expected); 

**Memory-Lapsed Slips** (caused by interruption through other people or devices; forgetting to complete action sequence)

Detecting slips is easier than mistakes, but requires visible feedback (e.g., Adjust the window)

Mistakes are hard to detect because nothing signals a wrong goal 



The Ten golden rules of Interface Design

1. Keep the interface simple
2. Speak the user's language
3. Be consistent and predictable
4. Provide feedback & be responsive
5. Minimize memory load
6. Avoid errors, help to recover, offer undo
7. Design clear exits and closed dialogs
8. Include help and documentation
9. Address diverse user needs
10. Hire a graphic designer

Make sure STN is: Complete, Reversible, Does not have any dangerous state

Phases of Technology:

Sweet spot: simplifies your life; rule-changing new functionality

Baroque phase: Complicates your life; feature creep
Visual reality: Producing the illusion of being a 3-dimensional world of computer-generated objects

PARC Devices: Tabs(use as active badge; use to shrink windows onto tab to carry)/Pads(paper crossover with laptop; scrap computer)/Boards(used as video screen; bulletin board; flip chart)

Ubicomp = disappearing computer = augmented reality = calm computing

DIA: Design-> Implementation-> Analyze

Human-Centered Design Process: Observation->Idea Generation-> Prototype-> Testing->Observation

Double-Diamond Model of Design: Discover Define Develop Deliver

Design Thinking: Empathize Define Ideate Prototype Test

Detailed Observation Framework: Space, Actors, Activities, Objects, Acts, Events, Time, Goals, Feelings

Personas: Precise description of users; act as stand-in for real users; personas are not elastic

Storyboard: Sequence of single images, like visual outline of a film; visual representation of a script, illustrates interaction



Paper Prototype: First prototypes, quick and cheap; hand-drawn, no computer (pro: not detailed, so designer can focus on import high-level UI design; con: dialog sequence hard to convey)

type A: storyboard-like (put several frames with sketched snapshots of the UI on one page)

type B: Flipbook (sketch each UI snapshot frame on separate  page)

type C: Post-It prototype (more interactive; dialogs, menus, windows in multiple layers)

Software Prototype: Medium fidelity prototype (more detailed, more precise, interactive; after paper prototype; mock-up of some aspects of the final UI; has important UI but no functionality)

How to limit prototypes: 

Vertical Prototype: few functions, but those implemented in detail; allows testing general design ideas

Horizontal Prototype: entire UI visible but no functionality: simulate each interaction step (nothing works)

prototyping tools: animation app; web; rapid development environment;

What is the key aspect of the participatory design: Involving the user as a part of the design team throughout the entire software process

Why evaluate?

 - To ensure that system matches user needs
 - Necessary even if design was already user-centered 
 - Evaluation should happen throughout the entire software development process


- To judge system features
- To judge effects on users
- To discover specific problems


Where to evaluate: Lab(with equipment; but natural environment is missing); In the field(more realistic; situations and behaviors more natural; better suitted for long-term studies; but noise; fell like a test)

participatory design: Involve users as part of design throughout the entire software process

Techniques for communication: Brainstroming; storyboarding; workshops; interviews; role play; prototype

Independent Variables(IVs) 	Dependent Variables(DVs)

Each level of an independent variable is called a **treatment**

Validity: Construct Validity; Internal Validity(higher); External Validity(lower); Conclusion Validity

Reliability: can be replicated by other research teams; Random errors(cannot be eliminated); Systematic errors(push the measured value into the same direction, e.g measurement instruments/procedures...)

Other evaluation methods: questionnaire, personal interviews—>before; email bug report, hotlines—>after

GOMS: Goals, Operations, Methods, Selection rules. --> To estimate execution and learning times before a system is built

Keystroke-Level Model: KPHMR(keying, pointing, homing, mentally preparing, responding)

R effects user actions: causality breakdown after 100ms; user will try after 250ms

Rules for placing M's:

delimiter: character making beginning (end) of meaningful unit

operators: K, P and H

argument: information supplied to a command

Rule 0: initial insertion for candidate Ms —> insert Ms in front of all Ks and Ps which select commands

Rule 1: Delete M between two operators if the second operator is fully anticipated e.g. PMK—>PK

Rule 2: deletion of Ms within cognitive units (contiguous sequence of typed character) 

e.g. "ls" —> MKMK—> MKK

Rule 3: deletion of Ms begore consecutive terminators e.g. "bla\\\" —> M3KMKMK —> M3KMKK

Rule 4: deletion of Ms that are terminators of commands (follows a constant string not for argument)

e.g. "ls " —> MKKMK —> MKKK



STN (State Transition Networks): Describes sequences of user actions and system responses

States: usually the system waiting for some user action

Transitions: which have a user action and a system response associated with them

Properties: Completeness; Reversibility; Dangerous states (some states you don't want to go)

​		    Determinism(several arcs for one action); Nested escapes; Consistency(modes and visibility)

Petri Nets: Better approach to dialogs that have several states at once

Design Techniques for responsiveness: Display import information first; Work in parallel; Optimize Queueing; Manage time dynamically; Test under different conditions

The top 5 performance hit: Hard disk access; large memory footprint; interlocking threads; unsuitable data and control structure; reinventing the wheel
